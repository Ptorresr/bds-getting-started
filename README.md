# Getting Started with Oracle Big Data Service

## Introduction
The purpose of this tutorial series is to help you get started with Oracle Big Data Service.  Learn how to create clusters, migrate existing clusters to the service, set up access, deploy Cloud SQL and other important tasks.

## What is Big Data Service?
Oracle Big Data Service is a platform cloud service specifically designed for a diverse set of big data use cases and workloads.  From short-lived clusters used to tackle specific tasks to long-lived clusters that manage large data lakes, Big Data Service scales to meet an organization’s requirements at a low cost and with the highest levels of security.
* Vertically integrated for Hadoop, Kafka, & Spark using Cloudera Enterprise Data Hub
* Highly secure, highly available clusters provisioned in minutes
* Expand on premise Hadoop; deploy test and development to cloud
* Any scale using high performance bare metal or cost effective VM shapes
* End-to-end data management; use with Autonomous Database, Analytics Cloud, OCI Streaming, OCI Data Catalog, OCI Data Science and OCI Data Flow
* Use Oracle SQL to query across Hadoop, Object Stores, Kafka and NoSQL with Cloud SQL
*Includes Oracle Big Data Spatial and Graph, Big Data Connectors and Oracle Data Integrator
